## DeepSeek Harness Module

The DeepSeek Harness module uses the following public projects as reference material. The article prose and diagrams are independently written; no upstream source code or book text is copied into this repository.

## Pi Coding Agent Module

The Pi module uses the following public sources as references. Its Chinese prose, examples, comparisons, and learning structure are independently adapted and rewritten for zero2Agent; no upstream source code or textbook prose is copied verbatim into this repository.

- [badlogic/pi-mono@a470b121bf683b4c2b9fc0b3a7c807de7e0cfe9c](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/a470b121bf683b4c2b9fc0b3a7c807de7e0cfe9c) — official implementation and documentation baseline, verified on 2026-08-24. Refer to the upstream repository for package-specific licenses and notices.
- [Pi official documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/) — current Skills, Extensions, Packages, Sessions, security, SDK, RPC, and runtime behavior.
- [Chunhao Zhang (hahhforest), *Build Your Own Pi / 动手学 Pi*](https://github.com/hahhforest/pi-textbook) — teaching reference for checkpoints, focused tests, failure experiments, the observable Agent Loop, session recovery, context rebuilding, trust gates, and evaluation. The textbook prose and original media are licensed [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The user-provided [Chasen Liao-hosted mirror](https://chasen-liao.github.io/pi-textbook-page/learn/prologue/) is used as the reading URL. zero2Agent changes the organization, examples, explanations, and scope rather than reproducing the textbook text.

It is not treated as a Pi built-in security boundary.
- [Pi Chinese documentation](https://pi-doc.com) — auxiliary Chinese-language navigation only; official latest documentation and source remain authoritative.
- [qualisero/awesome-pi-agent](https://github.com/qualisero/awesome-pi-agent) — historical community discovery only. The repository was archived on 2026-06-03 and states that its list is outdated, so it is not used as a current compatibility or security source.

## Nowcoder Interview Recollections

The interview-question updates dated 2026-08-16 were independently summarized from public interview recollections published from 2026-08-12 through 2026-08-15 in Nowcoder's [interview feed](https://www.nowcoder.com/?type=818_1). Public tutorial pages retain only generalized technical questions and company, role, or interview-round attribution.

At the user's explicit request, `.claude/skills/scrape-nowcoder/nowcoder-agent-excellent-full/` also keeps a non-site maintenance archive of selected interview recollections. New entries preserve the complete recorded interview sequence, including technical follow-ups, the author's recorded answers and interviewer feedback, coding tasks, and questions asked back to the interviewer. Each entry links to its Nowcoder source; account names, schools, author locations, specific personal outcomes, comments, recommendations, browser profiles, and login data are excluded. The complete browser scrape remains in a Git-ignored working directory and is not part of the repository archive.
